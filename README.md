👋 Hi, I’m Kristina Livesay. This account at the moment contains samples of work I have accumulated over a decade.
I have a decade of work experience as a C/C++ developer and engineer from Wolfram Research and Curtiss-Wright, Scientech.
I have taken a career break for the last few years, to grow my family, and during that time, I started to gain interest in child development and
psychology overall. I found some very interesting observations through reading the works of Mahler, Fairbarn and Masterson that 
have applications in learning and game theory.<br /> <br />
👀 I’m interested in large front ends, embedded systems, control systems, machine learning (decision problems, computer vision etc) and robotics. <br />
🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning fundamentals (Triple S book, Dan Roth notes etc.). <br />
💞️ I’m looking to work on any area of my interest or other interesting project.<br /><br />
